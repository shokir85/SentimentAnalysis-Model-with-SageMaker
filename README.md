This project has been completed as a part of Udacity DEEP LEARNING nanoDegree program. Sentiment Analysis Model with RNN LSTM has been deployed using Amazon SageMaker.


Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.
